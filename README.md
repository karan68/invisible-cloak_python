# Don't forget to mention when using this repo
# invisible-cloak_pyton

# This is a Python program that uses open cv and numpy library and screen capturing to make you invisible when you come in contact with red colored cloth

# How to use it:
     1) just clone this repo 
     2) run the python file 
     3) wait for the camera to screen record for some time.
     4) now to go in front of thr camera and use a red cloth and see yourself disapear.
     



# How it works:

   # This tutorial aims at explaining some key concepts of image processing using opencv with python. 
We will replace the current frame pixels corresponding to the cloth with the background pixels to generate the effect of an invisibility cloak. For this we need to store the frame of a static background.
